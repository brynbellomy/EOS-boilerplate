# EOS project boilerplate

To run:

```sh
$ ./docker-start.sh
$ ./docker-enter.sh

# now, inside the Docker container:
$ cd /work
$ ./create-accounts.sh
$ ./compile.sh
$ ./sample-tx.sh
```

The wallet and account info (generated by `create-accounts.sh` inside the Docker image) is saved in `wallet-info.txt` and `wallet-info-default.json`.

To change the created wallet and account names, edit the variables at the top of `create-accounts.sh`.

To test that the node can be communicated with via Javascript outside the Docker container, run `node index.js` in the `work/web` subfolder.
